Pseudocode (Detailed):
----------------------
note: ##  Dataset

Due to size constraints, the dataset (~70,000 images) is not included in this repository.

You can download it from [link-to-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset) and place it in a folder named `data/` at the project root:



1. Data Preparation:
   a. Define dataset path containing rice grain images in separate folders (e.g., Arborio, Basmati, etc.)
   b. Initialize ImageDataGenerator with image augmentation and 20% validation split.
   c. Create train and validation generators from directory using ImageDataGenerator.

2. Model Building (Transfer Learning):
   a. Load EfficientNetB4 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights.
   b. Set 'include_top=False' to remove the original classification head.
   c. Freeze base model layers to retain learned features.
   d. Add new classification layers:
      - GlobalAveragePooling2D to reduce spatial dimensions
      - Dropout to prevent overfitting
      - Dense layer with ReLU activation for learning non-linear patterns
      - Another Dropout layer
      - Final Dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification

3. Model Compilation and Training:
   a. Compile the model with Adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss.
   b. Set callbacks:
      - EarlyStopping to stop training if validation loss doesn't improve
      - ReduceLROnPlateau to reduce learning rate on plateaus
      - ModelCheckpoint to save the best model
   c. Train the model on training data with validation data for accuracy monitoring.

4. Flask Web App for Prediction:
   a. Initialize Flask app.
   b. Load the trained model using load_model().
   c. Create route for main page ("/") to upload an image.
   d. On form submission:
      - Receive uploaded image file
      - Save it to 'uploads/' folder
      - Preprocess image (resize to 224x224, convert to array, normalize)
      - Use model to predict class probabilities
      - Find the class with highest probability (argmax)
      - Return predicted class label and confidence score to user on the same page

5. Web Interface (HTML + CSS + JavaScript):
   a. Build form to upload images with drag-and-drop support and preview.
   b. Style form elements using CSS (green theme with smooth animations).
   c. Use JavaScript to handle image preview, form reset, and loading spinner.
